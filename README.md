# Breakdown of Challenge 13: Object Relational Mapping E-Commerce Back-End Application

## Description



The motivation behind creating this project was to implement object relational mapping concepts to make working with databases more manageable. This was done by taking working Express.js API starter code and configuring it to use Sequelize in order to interact with a mySQL database.

This project was built as the back-end of an e-commerce website, to test GET, POST, PUT and DELETE routes. 

This project demonstrates how you can use Javascript to interact with databases in order to make a functioning e-commerce website. 

This project emphasizes modularization of code based on the code's functionality in order to make the code more manageable. In this application, we use Sequelize in order to communicate with a MySQL database using Node.js.

## Installation

Steps required to install your project: 

In order to install this application please copy this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/savannahfausto/Fausto_E-Commerce_Back_End). Once downloaded to your local computer, run **npm install** in your terminal. Then cd into the db folder in order to login to a mySQL shell to **source schema.sql** and **use e-commerce.db**. After **exit**ing the mySQL shell, cd back to the root of the application and run **npm run seed** to have access to the information stored in the database tables. Finally, run **npm start** in order to start the applicaton. In order to test the application use a third-party application like Insomnia to test HTTP-based RESTful APIs.

## Usage

Find below instructions and examples for project use. 

With this application, you can test GET routes for all categories, products and tags on this e-commerce site. You can also test for single category, products and tags by ID with GET routes. Finally you can test POST routes to create new categories, products and tags, PUT routes to update categories, products and tags by ID, and DELETE routes to delete categories, products and tags by ID. 

Here is a link to a walkthrough video showing the different GET, POST, PUT and DELETE routes of this application using Insomnia. The video also demonstrates how to create the schema from a mySQL shell, seed the data and start the application:
